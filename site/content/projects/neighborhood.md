## Pre-flight sprint + anticipation

<p>I started this diary racing the clock: finish 100 hours on my personal site with twenty minutes to spare, then pack for San Francisco. A national rail strike turned school into Zoom, but it also gave me time to sketch goals and channel the jitters into writing.</p>
<p>The plan was simple: land in SF with momentum, keep sharing honest updates, and show up ready to build with Hack Clubbers I’d mostly met online.</p>

## Arrival, pizza, and zero sleep

<p>Day 1 was a blur: solo flight, unexpected border interview (“I’m here to build stuff with internet nerds”), hauling gear uphill, then getting whisked straight to a midnight pizza party. Housemates had full setups; I had a couch pillow and an airplane blanket.</p>
<p>I still wrote it all down—sleep deprivation, culture shock, and the promise that tomorrow would feel less overwhelming.</p>

## Finding routine in the chaos

<p>Day 2 hit hard: doubts, a foggy brain, and Paolo asking what I wanted to build. I found structure by wandering—cafés at sunrise, Target runs for towels, accidental detours to LinkedIn HQ (yes, I asked for stickers), and grocery missions with five cultures worth of breakfast preferences.</p>
<p>Documenting each beat made the house feel less overwhelming and turned strangers into collaborators.</p>

## City adventures + Apple Vision Pro

<p>Week one became a montage: sunrise walks, Salesforce Park co-working, UNO in Chinatown, and a surprise Apple Vision Pro demo where we all tried Excel mid-air. Nights meant burritos in Dolores Park, impromptu disco ball repairs, and logging programming hours anywhere with Wi-Fi.</p>

## GitHub HQ + ComfyUI hack night

<p>The highlight of week two: a ComfyUI mini-hackathon inside GitHub HQ. Security vests labeled “SSH,” RTX 5090 giveaways we didn’t win, and a depth-map workflow that actually shipped. Those entries captured the feeling of working next to 30 builders who all showed up purely to make things.</p>

## House experiments, Pao, and Freedom Week

<p>Halfway through the residency we pushed for “Freedom Week”—a break from the 40-hour tracker to ship something new and tell the story on video. That spawned <em>Pao</em>, a real-world stealth selfie game inspired by Among Us paranoia, plus countless midnight coding sessions, guitar breaks, and stairwell skate tricks.</p>

## The ending nobody expected

<p>As quickly as Neighborhood started, it ended—calls to the house, a program shutdown, then a slim chance to stay. I helped clean plumbing disasters, packed chairs across town, and watched Thomas deliver the final announcement before heading home to document what the month meant.</p>
<p>The last entry asks for a DM if you make it through all 739 lines. People actually wrote back.</p>
