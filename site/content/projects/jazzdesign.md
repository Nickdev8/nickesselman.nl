## Editorial tone and layout system

<p>We paired Spectral headings with Inter body copy, kept the palette to charcoal, cream, and copper, and let oversized whitespace give her photography room to breathe.</p>

## Lightweight CMS for quick edits

<p>The site runs on structured PHP arrays. New commissions, rates, or testimonials live in one file, so Jessie can update everything from her laptop without touching a dashboard.</p>
