## Shipping PartyVR in 100 hours

<p>I landed in Shanghai with a Quest headset, a sketchbook full of chaotic party ideas, and a promise to demo something fun at the end of the trip. I built PartyVR - a living-room-sized playground filled with throwable cakes, physics-based mini games, and a soundtrack that gets louder the more players join.</p>
<p>The hardest part was networking. Every avatar needed to stay in sync, but late-night builds kept desyncing unless I rewrote entire systems. By day three I had authoritative movement, synced props, and a cheeky lobby that doubled as a tutorial.</p>

## Open café energy

<p>Hack Club rented a storefront, filled it with extension cords, and invited the neighborhood to try our projects. My favourite moment was watching a group of students queue for the headset while the rest of us turned fruit from the market into actual juice.</p>
<p>The event also meant documenting everything: screenshots, stand-ups, and five-minute lightning talks. That habit of narrating progress followed me home.</p>

## What stuck with me

<ul>
    <li>Scoping ruthlessly so a multiplayer idea actually ships.</li>
    <li>Designing onboarding for people who have never tried VR.</li>
    <li>Documenting progress in public - every day mattered.</li>
</ul>
