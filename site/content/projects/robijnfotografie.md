## Shot-first storytelling

<p>Hero blocks use responsive art direction so vertical portraits stay crisp on desktop and mobile. Galleries reuse one component that supports drag-to-pan, keyboard navigation, and per-shoot color grading.</p>

## Booking + SEO polish

<p>A multi-step lead form filters inquiries by shoot type, pushes them into Robijn’s Notion CRM, and fires a confirmation email with prep tips. I also added structured data + Open Graph previews so her blog posts share cleanly.</p>
