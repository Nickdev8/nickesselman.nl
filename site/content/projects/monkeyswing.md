## Designing movement that feels sticky

<p>The core mechanic is a physics-based rope that clamps onto anchors. I wrote a custom spring solver so I could tweak gravity curves and boost the player mid-swing without the motion exploding.</p>

## Shipping polish quickly

<ul>
    <li>Hand-drawn VFX that stretch when you miss a hook.</li>
    <li>Haptics and crunchy sound design to reward perfect swings.</li>
    <li>Ghost runs so I could race myself during testing.</li>
</ul>
