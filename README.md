# Nick's Portfolio – [nickesselman.nl](https://nickesselman.nl)

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
I'm **Nick**, and this site was created for the Hack Club event **Neighborhood**.

## About This Site

This portfolio is a showcase of my personal projects, skills, and interests. I built it to share my work with the Hack Club community and anyone interested in what I do. The site is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

## Why I Made This

I wanted a central place to display my projects and experiments, and the Hack Club Neighborhood event was the perfect motivation to finally build it. It’s a way for me to document my progress.

## What You’ll Find Here
