        Juice was a event hosted by HackClub in Shanghai, China.<br>
        We had to make a Game in 100 hours, and when we were allowed to fly to China. where we hosted a <a
            href="#OpenCafe" id="OpenCafeLink"> Open Cafe</a><br>
        and in total, there were almost 100 people that completed there 100 hours

                I created a game called <a
                    href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/partyvr/9355384034552901/?require_login=true"
                    target="_blank">PartyVR</a>.<br>
                Imagine a wild party, but in virtual reality—dodge flying cakes, dance with your friends, and compete in
                wacky
                mini-games, all in the same virtual room!<br>
                Building it was a blast. I used Unity and the Meta XR SDK, and spent way too many late nights laughing
                at my own
                bugs.<br>

                The hardest part? Networking!<br>
                Getting everyone’s avatars to move smoothly together was like herding virtual cats.<br>
                Objects would randomly fly across the room, get stuck in walls, or—most of the time—not move at all for
                other
                players because everything kept desyncing.<br>
                Sometimes, you’d throw a cake and only you would see it fly, while everyone else just saw it floating in
                midair!<br>
                But after a lot of trial and error (and some questionable dance moves in my living room), I finally got
                it
                working... at least most of the time.<br>

                Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to fully complete the game before the deadline.<br>
                There were still a few bugs left, and some features I wanted to add just didn’t make it in time.<br>
                But even with all the chaos, it was an amazing learning experience—and I’m excited to keep working on
                PartyVR in
                the future!<br>

                Since it was my first time traveling alone, I decided it would be best to bring my brother with me.<br>
                We both had a great time and made many new friends.<br>
                <br>
                When we arrived, we immediately noticed so many differences in the culture.<br>
                I especially enjoyed trying all the different foods and attempting to communicate with people who didn’t
                speak
                the same language.<br>

                One thing that really stood out to me was the lack of tourists.<br>
                Of course, there were some, but not nearly as many as in other countries.<br>
                There were also many people who stared at us and took pictures.<br>
                I think this was because we were the only white people in the area.<br>

                At the “open cafe” we hosted, we all demoed our games and showed them to random people who stopped
                by.<br>
                But unfortunately, since I made a multiplayer game, I was not able to demo it.<br>
                <br>
                We found some local people selling all kinds of fruits like melons, oranges, and mangos, which we made
                juice
                from.<br>

                Both making the juice and showing our games led to lots of laughter and fun times with all the Hack
                Clubbers
                there.<br>
                <br>
                The cultural differences that surprised me the most were the old buildings integrated with new
                technology.<br>
                Since we weren’t directly in the center of Shanghai but more in the popular downtown, we saw many places
                with
                random cabling running across the street.<br>

                QR codes were everywhere, especially for things like restaurant menus—almost everything was done with a
                QR
                code.<br>
                The most popular app for this was Alipay, which is used for paying, ordering food, and even renting
                bikes.<br>
                Another app, Didi, is like the Chinese version of Uber and is used for getting around the city.<br>
