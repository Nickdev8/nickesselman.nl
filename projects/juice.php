        Juice was a event hosted by HackClub in Shanghai, China.<br>
        We had to make a Game in 100 hours, and when we were allowed to fly to China. where we hosted a <a

        and in total, there were almost 100 people that completed there 100 hours

    <h2 class="headline">The Game I Made</h2>
    <p>
        I created a game called <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/partyvr/9355384034552901/"
            target="_blank">PartyVR</a>.<br>
        Imagine a wild party, but in virtual reality—dodge flying cakes, dance with your friends, and compete in wacky mini-games, all in the same virtual room!<br>
        Building it was a blast. I used Unity and the Meta XR SDK, and spent way too many late nights laughing at my own bugs.<br>

    <h2 class="subheadline">My Struggle</h2>
    <p>
        The hardest part? Networking!<br>
        Getting everyone’s avatars to move smoothly together was like herding virtual cats.<br>
        Objects would randomly fly across the room, get stuck in walls, or—most of the time—not move at all for other players because everything kept desyncing.<br>
        Sometimes, you’d throw a cake and only you would see it fly, while everyone else just saw it floating in midair!<br>
        But after a lot of trial and error (and some questionable dance moves in my living room), I finally got it working... at least most of the time.<br>

    <h2 class="subheadline">Not Quite Finished</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to fully complete the game before the deadline.<br>
        There were still a few bugs left, and some features I wanted to add just didn’t make it in time.<br>
        But even with all the chaos, it was an amazing learning experience—and I’m excited to keep working on PartyVR in the future!<br>

        Since it was my first time traveling alone, I decided it would be best to bring my brother with me.<br>
        We both had a great time and made many new friends.<br>
        <br>
        When we arrived, we immediately noticed so many differences in the culture.<br>
        I especially enjoyed trying all the different foods and attempting to communicate with people who didn’t speak the same language.<br>

        <br>
        One thing that really stood out to me was the lack of tourists.<br>
        Of course, there were some, but not nearly as many as in other countries.<br>
        There were also many people who stared at us and took pictures.<br>
        I think this was because we were the only white people in the area.<br>

        <br>
        At the “open cafe” we hosted, we all demoed our games and showed them to random people who stopped by.<br>
        But unfortunately, since I made a multiplayer game, I was not able to demo it.<br>
        <br>
        We found some local people selling all kinds of fruits like melons, oranges, and mangos, which we made juice from.<br>
        <img src="making-juice.jpg" alt="Making juice with local fruits" style="max-width:100%;"><br>
        Both making the juice and showing our games led to lots of laughter and fun times with all the Hack Clubbers there.<br>
        <br>
        The cultural differences that surprised me the most were the old buildings integrated with new technology.<br>
        Since we weren’t directly in the center of Shanghai but more in the popular downtown, we saw many places with random cabling running across the street.<br>

        QR codes were everywhere, especially for things like restaurant menus—almost everything was done with a QR code.<br>
        The most popular app for this was Alipay, which is used for paying, ordering food, and even renting bikes.<br>
        Another app, Didi, is like the Chinese version of Uber and is used for getting around the city.<br>
