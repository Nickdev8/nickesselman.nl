### Day -8, The Days Leading Up to SF 6/10

## Almost There!

I’m typing this while racing to hit 100 hours of work on my website project-only 20 minutes to go! Once I cross that finish line, I’ll have exactly 16 days until my big trip to San Francisco.

## What Happened Today
When the trains went on strike today, everyone switched to online classes. Normally we’d get the day off, but apparently we’ve been too “rested” lately. So here I am-Zooming away, coffee in hand, multitasking like a champ while jotting down these notes.





### Day 1

## Before the flight
I arrived at Schiphol with my brother, mom, and dad. After a few hugs and a very real “this is it” moment at the gate, I waved goodbye and stepped into solo travel mode. Next stop: San Francisco. Alone. For real.

## My Flight,
The flight itself? Surprisingly chill. I somehow scored three seats to myself. I stretched out (kinda), watched Interstellar for the 2nd time, and vibed to music until sleep finally kicked in. Sure, it wasn’t five-star comfort, but it did the job.


## I arived!
Touchdown in San Francisco! But of course, my story couldn’t be that smooth, border control wasn’t quite sure what to make of my “I’m going to build stuff with internet nerds I met online” explanation. So they took me into a separate room for an “interview.”

After explaining Hack Club, convincing them I’m not a threat to national security, and answering a few curious questions, they gave me the green light.

## BART & The Hike
I took the BART (Bay Area metro) into the city, and then walked nearly 3 miles uphill with my backpack and suitcase. Welcome to San Francisco: the city of tech dreams.

## Pizza party
When I finally got to the house, Paolo and my roommates were already heading out, to a pizza-making party at the other Hack Club house. Even though I felt like a zombie, I tagged along. We made pizzas until 11pm, and by then my body had given up on being alive.

## Attempting Sleep
Everyone else had their bed setups ready with pillows and cozy blankets. Me? I had a couch pillow from the other house and a thin airplane blanket. It was freezing in the house. I barely slept. So yeah—end of Day 0, and I’m basically running on nothing.





### Day 2

## Morning After the Storm
After that awful night of tossing and turning, I gave up trying to sleep by 6am. My body thought it was 3pm anyway. I got up, hit the toilet, and had a chill early-morning chat with one of my roommates. I ate an apple, walked to a local café, and called my mom.

I told her the truth:
“This isn’t really what I expected... I’m not sure I want to stay the full time.”
Big feelings, right from the start.

## Chat With Paolo
Later, Paolo (a organizer and housemate) sat down with me to chat about what I wanted to build here while im at San fransico.
Truth be told, I had no clue. I thought it’d be like Juice in Shanghai, but this time, there was too much freedom. No structure. No guide rails. Just… “do your thing.”
It hit me: I’ve never really lived independently, let alone worked in a self-directed way from 9 to 5. It was overwhelming, and I started questioning whether I’d made the right choice.

## 12PM & Some Normalcy
After sulking in bed for way too long, Paolo and Abby suggested we head to the Hack Club open space—a big, cozy area where everyone was coding, vibing, and doing their thing.
We grabbed lunch on the way, and honestly, I finally started to feel a little bit like myself again.

But the peace didn’t last long—
Paolo dipped early with a headache, and Abby went out for food… and just *never came back.* So now I was alone, surrounded by laptops and strangers, wondering what to do next.

Cue: spontaneous side quest.

## The Random Adventure

Feeling restless, I called my brother just to check in, and my dad jumped on the call too. With my family on the line and no destination in mind, I just started walking—somewhere. Anywhere.

That “anywhere” turned out to be… **LinkedIn HQ.**
Yup. Just stumbled right into the corporate heart of networking itself.

There was a big public lounge space inside—suits and startup folks having Very Important Conversations™. And me? I walked up to the front desk like,
“Hey, got any stickers?”
A few minutes later, I walked out with some LinkedIn swag: stickers and a branded keychain lanyard. Mission accomplished.

## The Great Pillow Rescue
After wrapping up the call, I realized I had unfinished business: **Sleep.**
Last night’s setup, rock-hard couch pillow and a too-small airplane blanket—wasn’t going to cut it again.

So I went on a heroic quest to Target, hunting for something softer, warmer, and just… not awful.
It wasn’t exactly a luxury hotel haul, but it was a major upgrade. Mission: *mostly* successful.

## Grosry shopping
us 5 went a a nearby store to get some breakfast and other things to eat, but because we all have soch difference in culture, we could not really decide on what we wanted, but after foolishly looking around for 10 minuts we finali decided to make a list if the items we wanted to get, and then we split up to get all of the items. my job was.. get appels and bannanas. and since we were litterly standing next to the fruit, i got it in less than 10 secodns.

after all of that we went back home, and becouse it was already around 7pm i was really hungry, and what do you do if you want to eat... i went to bed untill 11pm becouse i was still so fucking tired with little to no sleep.

## Midnight dinner
I woke up at 11pm and still needed to eat something. and i decited eat a pb&j sanwich, just some peanet butter and jam onto a slice of bread, thats it, that was by dinner.






### Day 3, feeling better
## Morning
I woke up arount 6am becouse the jetlag was still hitting me. and since i did not want to wake someone up, i directly went on a walk with my fruit a bought the day before. And i called my family back home to tell them that i was feeling, much much better here, yesterday i felt really down and sad becouse i did not feel it was any fun. but with my adventure yesterday and the morning walk, I reallized that i have to make my own fun, do more advientures and
