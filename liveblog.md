## Almost There!

I’m typing this while racing to hit 100 hours of work on my website project-only 20 minutes to go! Once I cross that finish line, I’ll have exactly 16 days until my big trip to San Francisco.

## What Happened Today
When the trains went on strike today, everyone switched to online classes. Normally we’d get the day off, but apparently we’ve been too “rested” lately. So here I am-Zooming away, coffee in hand, multitasking like a champ while jotting down these notes.

### Day 1

## Before the flight
I arrived at Schiphol with my brother, mom, and dad. After a few hugs and a very real “this is it” moment at the gate, I waved goodbye and stepped into solo travel mode. Next stop: San Francisco. Alone. For real.

## My Flight,
The flight itself? Surprisingly chill. I somehow scored three seats to myself. I stretched out (kinda), watched Interstellar for the 2nd time, and vibed to music until sleep finally kicked in. Sure, it wasn’t five-star comfort, but it did the job.


## I arived!
Touchdown in San Francisco! But of course, my story couldn’t be that smooth, border control wasn’t quite sure what to make of my “I’m going to build stuff with internet nerds I met online” explanation. So they took me into a separate room for an “interview.”

After explaining Hack Club, convincing them I’m not a threat to national security, and answering a few curious questions, they gave me the green light.

## BART & The Hike
I took the BART (Bay Area metro) into the city, and then walked nearly 3 miles uphill with my backpack and suitcase. Welcome to San Francisco: the city of tech dreams.

## Pizza party
When I finally got to the house, Paolo and my roommates were already heading out, to a pizza-making party at the other Hack Club house. Even though I felt like a zombie, I tagged along. We made pizzas until 11pm, and by then my body had given up on being alive.

## Attempting Sleep
Everyone else had their bed setups ready with pillows and cozy blankets. Me? I had a couch pillow from the other house and a thin airplane blanket. It was freezing in the house. I barely slept. So yeah—end of Day 0, and I’m basically running on nothing.

### Day 2

## Morning After the Storm
After that awful night of tossing and turning, I gave up trying to sleep by 6am. My body thought it was 3pm anyway. I got up, hit the toilet, and had a chill early-morning chat with one of my roommates. I ate an apple, walked to a local café, and called my mom.

I told her the truth:
“This isn’t really what I expected... I’m not sure I want to stay the full time.”
Big feelings, right from the start.

## Chat With Paolo
Later, Paolo (a organizer and housemate) sat down with me to chat about what I wanted to build here while im at San fransico.
Truth be told, I had no clue. I thought it’d be like Juice in Shanghai, but this time, there was too much freedom. No structure. No guide rails. Just… “do your thing.”
It hit me: I’ve never really lived independently, let alone worked in a self-directed way from 9 to 5. It was overwhelming, and I started questioning whether I’d made the right choice.

## 12PM & Some Normalcy
After moping on my bed for a while, Paolo and Abby invited me to go to the Hack Club “open area”—a co-working space where people just code, chill, and hang out.
We stopped for lunch on the way, and for the first time that day, I started feeling slightly more human.
