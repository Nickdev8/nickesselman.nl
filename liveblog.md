### Day -8, The Days Leading Up to SF 6/10

## Almost There!

I’m typing this while racing to hit 100 hours of work on my website project-only 20 minutes to go! Once I cross that finish line, I’ll have exactly 16 days until my big trip to San Francisco.

## What Happened Today
When the trains went on strike today, everyone switched to online classes. Normally we’d get the day off, but apparently we’ve been too “rested” lately. So here I am-Zooming away, coffee in hand, multitasking like a champ while jotting down these notes.





### Day 1

## Before the flight
I arrived at Schiphol with my brother, mom, and dad. After a few hugs and a very real “this is it” moment at the gate, I waved goodbye and stepped into solo travel mode. Next stop: San Francisco. Alone. For real.

## My Flight,
The flight itself? Surprisingly chill. I somehow scored three seats to myself. I stretched out (kinda), watched Interstellar for the 2nd time, and vibed to music until sleep finally kicked in. Sure, it wasn’t five-star comfort, but it did the job.


## I arived!
Touchdown in San Francisco! But of course, my story couldn’t be that smooth, border control wasn’t quite sure what to make of my “I’m going to build stuff with internet nerds I met online” explanation. So they took me into a separate room for an “interview.”

After explaining Hack Club, convincing them I’m not a threat to national security, and answering a few curious questions, they gave me the green light.

I took the BART (Bay Area metro) into the city, and then walked nearly 3 miles uphill with my backpack and suitcase. Welcome to San Francisco: the city of tech dreams.

## Pizza party
When I finally got to the house, Paolo and my roommates were already heading out, to a pizza-making party at the other Hack Club house. Even though I felt like a zombie, I tagged along. We made pizzas until 11pm, and by then my body had given up on being alive.

## Attempting Sleep
Everyone else had their bed setups ready with pillows and cozy blankets. Me? I had a couch pillow from the other house and a thin airplane blanket. It was freezing in the house. I barely slept. So yeah—end of Day 0, and I’m basically running on nothing.





### Day 2

## Morning After the Storm
After that awful night of tossing and turning, I gave up trying to sleep by 6am. My body thought it was 3pm anyway. I got up, hit the toilet, and had a chill early-morning chat with one of my roommates. I ate an apple, walked to a local café, and called my mom.

I told her the truth:
“This isn’t really what I expected... I’m not sure I want to stay the full time.”
Big feelings, right from the start.

## Chat With Paolo
Later, Paolo (a organizer and housemate) sat down with me to chat about what I wanted to build here while im at San fransico.
Truth be told, I had no clue. I thought it’d be like Juice in Shanghai, but this time, there was too much freedom. No structure. No guide rails. Just… “do your thing.”
It hit me: I’ve never really lived independently, let alone worked in a self-directed way from 9 to 5. It was overwhelming, and I started questioning whether I’d made the right choice.

## 12PM & Some Normalcy
After sulking in bed for way too long, Paolo and Abby suggested we head to the Hack Club open space—a big, cozy area where everyone was coding, vibing, and doing their thing.
We grabbed lunch on the way, and honestly, I finally started to feel a little bit like myself again.

But the peace didn’t last long—
Paolo dipped early with a headache, and Abby went out for food… and just *never came back.* So now I was alone, surrounded by laptops and strangers, wondering what to do next.

Cue: spontaneous side quest.

## The Random Adventure

Feeling restless, I called my brother just to check in, and my dad jumped on the call too. With my family on the line and no destination in mind, I just started walking—somewhere. Anywhere.

That “anywhere” turned out to be… **LinkedIn HQ.**
Yup. Just stumbled right into the corporate heart of networking itself.

There was a big public lounge space inside—suits and startup folks having Very Important Conversations™. And me? I walked up to the front desk like,
“Hey, got any stickers?”
A few minutes later, I walked out with some LinkedIn swag: stickers and a branded keychain lanyard. Mission accomplished.

## The Great Pillow Rescue
After wrapping up the call, I realized I had unfinished business: **Sleep.**
Last night’s setup, rock-hard couch pillow and a too-small airplane blanket—wasn’t going to cut it again.

So I went on a heroic quest to Target, hunting for something softer, warmer, and just… not awful.
It wasn’t exactly a luxury hotel haul, but it was a major upgrade. Mission: *mostly* successful.

# Grocery Chaos
Later in the day, the five of us decided to stock up on breakfast and other essentials. Easy, right?
Wrong. Turns out that when you mix five people from five different cultures in one grocery store, decision-making becomes a whole thing.

We aimlessly wandered around for ten solid minutes debating cereal vs. oats vs. whatever. Eventually, someone had the genius idea to make a list. Once that was done, we split up into mini-missions. My assignment? Apples and bananas.
And where were we standing? Literally next to the fruit section. Mission time: 10 seconds. Personal record.

By the time we got back, it was already pushing 7pm, and I was starving. So naturally… I went to bed. Because when you’re running on two hours of sleep and existential dread, hunger takes a backseat to unconsciousness.

# Midnight Dinner
I woke up around 11pm, still groggy and definitely still hungry. I stumbled into the kitchen, grabbed some bread, peanut butter, and jelly, and crafted the most basic—but strangely satisfying—PB&J sandwich.
That was dinner. No plate. No ceremony. Just survival.

Right as I was about to crash again, a few new roommates arrived. We’re now at 7 people in the house. Things are getting cozy.



### Day 3, feeling better
## Morning Reset
![alt text](images/liveblog/morningwalk.png){hole}
Woke up at 6am again—jet lag still doing its thing. I didn’t want to wake anyone, so I grabbed some fruit I heroically acquired the day before and went for a solo walk.

While walking, I called my family back home and told them something important:
**“I’m feeling way better today.”**

Yesterday hit hard. I was overwhelmed, lonely, and seriously questioning why I came. But after wandering LinkedIn HQ, grabbing Target blankets, and eating a midnight PB&J in silence, something clicked.

I realized I can’t just wait for the fun to find me—I have to go after it.

Paolo had told me there might be a rule where attending events counts as programming time—just show proof, and it counts for 2 hours to the counter. I’m definitely down for that. Less time behind a screen, more time exploring.

# Target Trip, Part II
![alt text](images/liveblog/target.png){right horizantal}
After my walk, I really wanted to shower… but I didn’t have a towel. So off we went—Target, round two. This time with four of us. We loaded up on towels, dish soap, plates, and whatever else we forgot during round one.

Now I’m back at the house, took my shower and finally sitting down to write this. Catching up on yesterday. Reflecting on today.
Finally feeling like I’m finding my rhythm.
