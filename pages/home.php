            <h1>Nick Esselman</h1>
            <p>I started Programming 7.914 years ago, back when i was 9. all on my own, I learned to code by trial and
                error. 
                <br>
                And after high school I went to Media College Amsterdam to study full stack development
                <br>
                At this time is when i joined HackClub. where i experienced a lot fun of new things. <a href="?page=HackClub"> Read here. </a>
                <br>
                its worth your time to read if you are someone or know somewhat that has even the slightest interest in
                coding. (and is below 18)
                <br>
                At HackClub i met some incredible people and i went on trips to places like Shanghai and San Francisco.
                Everything was paid for by HackClub.
